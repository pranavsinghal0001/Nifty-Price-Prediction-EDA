Nifty 50 Price Prediction Model:-

This repository contains a price prediction model for the Nifty 50 index, a benchmark index for the Indian equity market. 
The model utilizes data preprocessing, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning techniques to predict future price movements of the Nifty 50 index.

Content:-
Stock Price Prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for the price prediction model.
^NSEI.csv: CSV file containing the historical price data of the Nifty 50 index.
README.md: This README file providing an overview of the project.

Installation:-
To run the Jupyter Notebook locally, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
keras

Model Workflow:-
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the historical price data, identifying trends and patterns, and exploring relationships between variables.

Modeling: Splitting the data into training and testing sets, training a deep learning model using Keras, and evaluating the model's performance on the test set.

Results:-
The model achieves approx.60% accuracy on the test set, demonstrating its ability to predict future price movements of the Nifty 50 index.

Contributions:-
Contributions to improve this model or add new features are welcome! Please feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit pull requests.
